For example, if we have the number 112, which has 2 units, 1 ten, and 1 hundred, and we multiply it by 10, we will get a number with 20 units, 10 tens, and 10 hundreds. This means that 20 units will become 2 tens, 10 tens will become 1 hundred, and 10 hundreds will become 1 thousand, resulting in the number 1,120. So, when we multiply a number by 10, we add a zero to the right of the original number.",
