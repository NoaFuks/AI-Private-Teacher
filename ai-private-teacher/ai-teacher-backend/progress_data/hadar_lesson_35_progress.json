For example, if we have the number 112, which has 2 units, 1 ten, and 1 hundred, and we multiply it by 10, we will get a number with 20 units, 10 tens, and 10 hundreds. This means that the units will move to the tens place as tens, the tens will move to the hundreds place as hundreds, and the hundreds will move to the thousands place as thousands. So, the number 112 becomes 1,120 when we multiply it by 10. Therefore, when we increase a number by multiplying it by 10, we add a 0 to the right of the original number.",
