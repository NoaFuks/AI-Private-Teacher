This system involves the digits 0-9 and the place values increase by a factor of 10 each time you move to the left. For example, if you have the number 53, the 3 is in the ones place and the 5 is in the tens place. When we want to increase a number by a factor of 10, we simply move it one place value to the left. For example, if we have the number 53 and we want to increase it by a factor of 10, we get 530. In the decimal system, the letters A to T can also represent numerical values. Operations like addition and subtraction can be done easily with these numbers, making math fun and practical!",
