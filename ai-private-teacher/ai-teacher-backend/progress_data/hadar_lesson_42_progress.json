For example, if we have the number 112, which consists of 2 units, 1 ten, and 1 hundred, when we increase it by a factor of 10, we get the number 1,120. This is because the 2 units move to the tens place as two tens, the 1 ten moves to the hundreds place as one hundred, and the 1 hundred moves to the thousands place as one thousand. So, when we increase a number by a factor of 10, we are essentially adding a zero to the right of the original number.",
