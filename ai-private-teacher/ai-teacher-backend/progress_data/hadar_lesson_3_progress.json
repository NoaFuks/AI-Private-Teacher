When we increase a number by 10 or 100, we are making it ten or a hundred times larger, and when we decrease it, we are making it smaller. We also use letters like A to Z in math to represent values or variables in equations. Understanding arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the realm of natural numbers is fundamental to solving math problems effectively.",
