            "lesson_summary": "Summary of segment 1: In math, we often work with natural numbers within a certain range, such as up to 10,000. The decimal structure is important to understand, where each place value represents a factor of 10. For example, when we increase or decrease a number by 10 or 100, we are changing the value accordingly. Another key concept is the ordering of numbers, from smallest to largest, using the alphabetical order of the letters from A to Z. Finally, within this numerical field, operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are vital to solving math problems efficiently. Learning about these fundamental principles will help us master different math skills and solve complex problems with ease.",
