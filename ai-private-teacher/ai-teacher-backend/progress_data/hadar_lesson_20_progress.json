For example, if we have the number 112, which has 2 ones, 1 ten, and 1 hundred, when we multiply it by 10, we get a number with 20 ones, 1 ten turning into 10 tens, and 1 hundred becoming 10 hundreds. This means that 20 ones will move to the tens place as two tens, 10 tens will move to the hundreds place as one hundred, and 10 hundreds will move to the thousands place as one thousand, giving us the number 1,120. Therefore, when we multiply a number by 10, we add a 0 to the right of the original number.",
