For example, if we place the numbers from 1 to 3 in order, 3 comes after 2 and before 3. In another example, if we have a total of 9,000 and need to place it on the number line, we would place it between 8,999 and 9,001. Understanding the order and placement of numbers is important in math and can help us solve problems, like figuring out the number of ribs and joints in a human body or counting the days from the beginning of counting the Omer to Lag BaOmer. So, knowing how to place and organize numbers is a key skill in mathematics.",
