We have also been studying the decimal system, where numbers can be increased or decreased by factors of 10 and 100. Another interesting thing we have learned is the values of letters from A to Z, and how they relate to numbers. Additionally, we have been practicing our arithmetic skills with large numbers and performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's fascinating to see how everything ties together in the world of math!",
